REFERENCES:
I dont have specific references but i have surfed the net for pre defined functions of panda , numpy , matplotlib and finance, because I am not yet comfortable
in using these libraries and i also dont remember their predefined functions, but i am practicing these daily.
I have surfed the net for formulas of correlation (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/correlation.asp) and sharpe ratio(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp).
